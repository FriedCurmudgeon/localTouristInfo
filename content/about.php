<h2><?php echo _aboutLink ?> <?php echo $siteShortTitleLng ?></h2>

<h3>Who and how</h3>
<p>

My name is Thor Bjarte, and I'm the creator of this web service.<br><br>
I have used the free <a href="http://leafletjs.com" title="Leaflet" target="_blank">LeafletJS</a> as framework to create the map.<br>
The map markers are stored in a database for easy maintenance.

</p>
<h3>Why</h3>
<p>

I created <?php echo $siteShortTitleLng ?> because I wanted to show visitors and new villagers what <i>The Green Village</i> has to offer.<br><br>
This is a non-profit service provided for free for anyone to use.<br>
If you want to support my work I'd be very happy if you would <a href="https://buymeacoffee/tngld" title="Buy me a coffee" targert="_blank">buy me a coffee</a> ðŸ˜„.<br> This would help in maintaining this service.<br><br>

If you have any suggestions or know of any locations that could be nice to have on the map, feel free send me an email @ <b><?php echo hide_email($siteContactEmail); ?></b>.
