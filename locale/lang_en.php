You will find information about how to do that here.<br>

<h3>What do I get as a sponsor?</h3>
As a marker-sponsor you get to decide what information the marker-associated popup should contain. Like descripton, URL and picture/logo. You also get a badge on the popup that shows that it is a sponsored marker.<br>
That's not all, you will also get your logo on the <strong>sponsors page</strong>.<br>
And finally, you will get accreditation from everyone that uses this service - visitors, tourists and villagers.<br>
<br>
<strong>That's not bad.</strong><br>
<br>
</p>
<p>
    <h3>Price and payment</h3>
    As this service is only in the start-pit yet, we need to make things simple both for you and for us.<br>
